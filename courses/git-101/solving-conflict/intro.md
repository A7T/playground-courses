In this scenario you'll learn how you can share the changes in your repository with other people and combine their changes into your repository. This environment has been configured with a Git repository with a single commit. A remote repository is configured but has not been linked to the local repository.

With Git being a distributed version control system it means the local repository contains all the logs, files and changes made since the repository was initialised. To ensure that everyone is working on the most recent version changes need to be shared. When sharing these changes with other repositories only the differences will be synced making the process extremely fast.
